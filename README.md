# **Memory Game Project**

The project is a memory game based on matching paired symbols by turning over cards.

The project was created and relies heavily on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

The JavaScript code was broken down to include pre-initialized variables, arrays and small functions to help make the code more readable. All the HTML, CSS and JavaScript contained descriptive class, ID, variables and array names.

The game will start with a modal window asking the player to begin the game and explaining how to play the game.

Once they click ‘start game’ the timer will start immediately and will stop once the game was finished.

During gameplay the star rating and move count is tracked. A move count is defined as turning over 2 cards and not 1. The star ratings are based on how many moves the player uses to complete the game.

The game will be marked as finished once the all cards have been matched to their corresponding symbol which then displays another modal window with the game statistics.

In this modal window the player is then offered another game.
